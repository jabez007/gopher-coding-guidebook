# Gopher Coding Guidebook

This monorepo is a self-paced, project-based curriculum designed to help experienced developers learn Go with an emphasis on building production-grade gRPC microservices.

The learning path is divided into three progressive phases:

## ðŸ“š Phases

### ðŸŒ“ Phase 1: Go Fundamentals
Small, focused CLI projects to get hands-on with Go syntax, tooling, and concurrency.

### ðŸŒ• Phase 2: RESTful Microservices
Build a REST API, connect it to a database, and containerize it for Kubernetes.

### ðŸŒ— Phase 3: gRPC Microservices
Dive into Protocol Buffers, gRPC service definitions, streaming, and authentication.

## ðŸ§° Prerequisites

- Go 1.20+ installed
- Docker & Kubernetes (for Phase 2 & 3)
- Familiarity with building REST APIs (helpful but not required)
